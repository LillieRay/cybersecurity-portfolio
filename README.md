# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome!, I'm Lillie Ray  a tech professional transitioning into cybersecurity with a strong foundation in IT support, Azure, and security concepts.

This repo is where I document my hands on practice and learning across areas like:
-  SOC analysis and incident response
- Threat detection and alert triage
- Vulnerability management
- Cloud security (with a focus on Azure)
- Security documentation and processes

### Labs and Projects (coming soon)
I'll be adding:
- Log analysis walkthroughs
- Packet captures and write-ups
- Vulnerability scan reviews
- PowerShell and CLI scripts

> **Goal:** To grow into a role where I can help detect, respond to, and prevent security incidents in real world environments.
